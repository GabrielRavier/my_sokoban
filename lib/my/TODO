FILE subsystem
Reach 100% coverage in tests
faster memchr
faster memmem (that passes tests lol)
assembly memset
search.h
bsearch
getopt - Beyond POSIX compliance (next tests should be kernels/MidnightBSD/contrib/diff/gnulib-tests/test-getopt.h) (requires FILE subsystem)

Search in historical stuff - After PDP7
Better performance for my_getenv: Then increase NUM_VARS in setenv tests back to 8192
